This folder contains the Control Systems app created using MATLAB App Designer. MATLAB App Designer is an interactive development environment for designing an app layout using custom UI components. 

plots_final.exe is the app created to view various Control Systems plots (Bode plot, pole-zero plot and step response of a second-order transfer function) by changing the various parameters of a second order transfer function (gain K, damping ratio delta and natural frequency omega_n). 

app_designer_code.mlapp contains the code used to create the app. 

The below is the code view of the app in MATLAB App Designer:
